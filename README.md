I am proud to have had the opportunity to take on the challenge of building a project for a hackathon hosted by Techover. Leveraging my expertise in HTML and CSS,
I carefully followed the design instructions provided, ensuring that every detail, from colors and fonts to screen sizes and structure, aligned perfectly with the
final design.
This meticulous attention to detail extended to optimizing the project for both mobile devices and desktop, resulting in a seamless and visually cohesive
experience for users across different platforms.
<br>
Through this project, I not only honed my technical skills but also gained valuable experience in tackling real-world challenges and meeting strict design requirements.
By successfully executing the project and achieving alignment with the intended design,
This experience has further reinforced my passion for creating engaging and user-friendly
digital experiences, and I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of my skills in future projects.<br>
